# Server-Client-Interaction-Using-MultiThreading-in-Java
Concurrent execution  of multiple client threads (using separation of concern) sending HTTP request to a WebServer, uploading a random integer 'n' to the Server, and gets response from the Server after 'n' seconds.
Used Java Swing and Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) for GUI and Widgets creation and management.

## Steps to run the files
1. Clone/Download the repository

2. Either compile the java files by running the following from terminal/bash :-
i) javac Server.java
ii) javac Client.java
